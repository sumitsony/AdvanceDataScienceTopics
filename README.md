# AdvanceDataScienceTopics
#data wrangling #data visualization #statistical modeling #time series prediction
Advance Data Science Topics should include <but not limited to > :
  big data and big database and no-sqlmanagement, 
  nonlinear and Bayesian statistical models, 
  interactive visualizations, and  
  of course lots and lots of deep learning.
  
Objective of this repository is to introduce data science folks to the some advance topics that are relevant to those industry especially those <OIL, Retail, Healthcare and Finance> who are willing to spend on seemingly risky R&D kinda data science project with potential of huge ROI.

Finally looking at the Harvard course won't be a bad idea <Happy (Deep) learning :D > :
